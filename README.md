[![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/osminogin/express-coffee-seed.png)](https://gemnasium.com/osminogin/express-coffee-seed)

This is a Node.js Express CoffeeScript stack project seed originally based on
[Tom Wilson coffee-express template](https://github.io/twilson63), but use
Sequelize as database ORM (working with MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and PostgreSQL 
databases).

It comes ready to go with connect-assets that give you the option
to use coffee-script and stylus for the client side. (This feature temporarily 
disabled for much quickly tests passing)

* [Express](http://expressjs.com)
* [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org)
* [Bower](http://bower.io/)
* [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/)
* [Sequelize](http://sequelizejs.com/)
* [connect-assets](http://github.com/TrevorBurnham/connect-assets)

    true.should.equal true
```
